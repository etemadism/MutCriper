# MutCrisper: A Toolkit for Optimized gRNA Design in Base Editing Technology

You can run it on google colab: https://colab.research.google.com/github/etemadism/MutCrisper/blob/master/MutCrisper_Colab.ipynb 


This is a easy way to run MutCrisper in google colaboratory. The MutCrisper workflow, illustrated in Figure 1, is a comprehensive approach designed to enhance guide RNA (gRNA) design for precise base editing in genomic sequences. This workflow streamlines the process of selecting the most suitable gRNA sequences and predicting base editing outcomes.

This figure illustrates the step-by-step MutCrisper workflow for optimizing guide RNA (gRNA) design and predicting base editing outcomes. Starting with input data and utilizing the BE-hive machine learning model, the process recommends cell and base editor types, estimates efficiency, evaluates specificity, and provides comprehensive information for improved base editing experiments. Subsequent steps involve ARMS-PCR primer design and RFLP analysis to verify successful base editing outcomes.
